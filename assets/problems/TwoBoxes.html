<p>Two boxes of masses 16.0 kg and 24.0 kg, respectively are pushed across a level surface.  The coefficient of kinetic friction between the surfaces is 0.30.  The boxes are being pushed by a force of 135 N as shown in the diagram below.  Calculate each of the following.</p>
<p>a) The acceleration of the boxes.<br />
b) The force between the boxes.</p>
