<p>A 75kg cheetah exerts 0.12 kN on the ground backwards while running from an initial velocity of 15 m/s over 550 meters. Calculate the acceleration of the cheetah. Then using the acceleration, find the cheetah's final velocity after 550 meters. At that point, which of the following is the cheetah's total kinetic energy?</p>
<p>A. 74.4 kJ <br />
B. 66.6 kJ <br />
C. 1.7 kJ <br />
D. 8.5 kJ</p>
