<p>A simple pendulum consists of a bob of mass 1.8 kg attached to a string of length 2.3 m. The pendulum is held at an angle of 30o from the vertical by a light horizontal string attached to a wall, as shown above.</p>
<p>a) Draw a free-body diagram showing and labeling the forces on the bob in the position shown above. <br />
b) Calculate the tension in the horizontal string. <br />
c) The horizontal string is now cut close to the bob, and the pendulum swings down. Calculate the speed of the bob at its lowest position.</p>
