<p>A 70 kg woman and her 35 kg son are standing at rest on an ice rink, as shown above. They push against each other for a time of 0.60 s, causing them to glide apart. The speed of the woman immediately after they separate is 0.55 m/s. Assume that during the push, friction is negligible compared with the forces the people exert on each other.</p>
<p>a) Calculate the initial speed of the son after the push.<br />
b) Calculate the magnitude of the average force exerted on the son by the mother during the push.<br />
c) After the initial push, the friction that the ice exerts cannot be considered negligible, and the mother comes to rest after moving a distance of 7.0 m across the ice. If their coefficients of friction are the same, how far does the son move after the push?</p>
