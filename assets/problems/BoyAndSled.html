<p>A child pulls a 15 kg sled containing a 5.0 kg dog along a straight path on a horizontal surface. He exerts a force of 55 N on the sled at an angle of 20o above the horizontal, as shown in the figure above. The coefficient of friction between the sled and the surface is 0.22.</p>
<p>a) Calculate the acceleration of the system.<br />
b) Calculate the work done by the child’s pulling force as the system moves a distance of 7.0 m.<br />
c) At some later time, the dog rolls off the side of the sled. The child continues to pull with the same force. On the axes below, sketch a graph of speed u versus time t for the sled. Include both the sled’s travel with and without the dog on the sled. Clearly indicate with the symbol tr the time at which the dog rolls off.</p>
