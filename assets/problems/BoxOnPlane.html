<p>A box is being pushed at constant speed up an inclined plane to a vertical height of 3.0 m above the ground, as shown in the figure above. The person exerts a force parallel to the plane. The mass m of the box is 50 kg, and the coefficient of kinetic friction Î¼k between the box and the plane is 0.30.</p>
<p>a) What are the forces acting on the box?<br />
b) Calculate the friction force between the plane and the box.<br />
c) Calculate the work done by the person pushing the box, assuming the box is raised to the vertical height of 3.0 m.</p>
