<p>A 4700 kg truck carrying a 900 kg crate is traveling at 25 m/s to the right along a straight, level highway, as shown above. The truck driver then applies the brakes, and as it slows down, the truck travels 55 m in the next 3.0 s. The crate does not slide on the back of the truck.</p>
<p>a) Calculate the magnitude of the acceleration of the truck, assuming it is constant.<br />
b) Calculate the minimum coefficient of friction between the crate and truck that prevents the crate from sliding.</p>
