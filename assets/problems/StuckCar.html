<p>Your car is stuck in a mud hole. You are alone but have a long, strong rope. Having studied physics you tie the rope tautly to a telephone pole and pull on it sideways as in the figure below.</p>
<p>A) Find the forces exerted by the rope on the car when θ = 3 and you are pulling with a force of 400N and the car does not budge.<br />
B) How strong must the rope be if it takes a force F of 600 N to move the car when θ = 4.</p>
