<p>Several students are riding in bumper cars at an amusement park. The combined mass of car A and its occupants is 250 kg. The combined mass of car B and its occupants is 200 kg. Car A is 15 m away from car B and moving to the right at 2.0 m/s, when the driver decides to bump into car B, which is at rest.</p>
<p>Car A accelerates at 1.5m/s2 to a speed of 5.0 m s and then continues at constant velocity until it strikes car B. Calculate the total time for car A to travel the 15 m.</p>
