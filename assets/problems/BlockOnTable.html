<p>Consider a block (initially at rest) of mass 5 kg on a table top. Assume that the surface is frictionless. Let a pushing force of 50 N directed at an angle of 30 below the horizontal act on the block.</p>
<p>A) Find the acceleration of the block.<br />
B) Find the (normal) force that the table exerts on the block.</p>
